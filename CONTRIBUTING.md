# Contributing to Evolution Light Speed

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to make complex evolutionary theory accessible through interactive visualization.

## Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Bug Reports
- Use GitHub Issues
- Include screenshots/screen recordings
- Specify browser and OS
- Describe expected vs actual behavior

### 💡 Feature Ideas
- New visualizations of evolutionary dynamics
- Additional metrics from the paper
- Educational improvements
- Performance optimizations

### 📚 Documentation
- Clarify scientific concepts
- Add more examples
- Improve code comments
- Tutorial videos

### 🔬 Scientific Accuracy
If you spot issues with the implementation of the quasi-species equations or interpretation of Krakauer's paper, please open an issue with:
- Section/equation reference from the paper
- What's incorrect/missing
- Suggested correction

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecsplendid/evolution-light-speed.git
cd evolution-light-speed
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript where possible
- Follow existing React patterns
- Add comments for complex evolutionary algorithms
- Keep UI responsive (target 60fps)

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly (try various L, p, s combinations)
5. Submit PR with clear description

## Scientific Rigor
This is an educational tool, but accuracy matters:
- Cite equations from the paper
- Test edge cases
- Validate against known results
- Don't oversimplify the science
